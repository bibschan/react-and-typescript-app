# React and Typescript App
This project is a simple To Do list with two functionalities, adding and deleting. To develop this app, I used Typescript and React and learned how to integrate both resulting in a error-free and clean application. 

This application was created based on this Udemy Typescript course (https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript)

### How To Run
To install the React + Typescript template, I ran `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` in my local development folder.

To run this project, first `cd my-app` then run `npm start` to bring up your localhost server, the application will be running on port :3000
